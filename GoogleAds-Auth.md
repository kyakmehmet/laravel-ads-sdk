# GoogleAds API SDK (Authentication Guide)

This uses the [googleads-php-lib](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-php-lib) SDK for the [Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/start).

## (1) API Access

You need access before you can use the Google Ads API. You can also setup a [test account](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/overview#test_account) for sandbox mode.

**Developer tokens** â€“ are located in the API Center within your Google Ads account. Go to "Tools" -> "API Center"

2) Enable Google Ads API

3) "Create Credentials" for OAuth client (fill in name, email and add in Google Ads API as the scope)

5) Fill in .env `ADWORDS_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` and `ADWORDS_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`

## (3) Generate Refresh Token
